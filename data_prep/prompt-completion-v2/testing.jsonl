Have you noticed any other symptoms besides fatigue?\nPatient: Yes, I've been having pain in my left lower side for a while now.\nDoctor: Okay, I understand. When did the pain become severe?\nPatient: It became really bad a few months ago, so I went to the emergency room.\nDoctor: I see. And what happened at the emergency room?\nPatient: They did a CT scan and found an infiltrate into my greater omentum and multiple nodules in my small bowel mesentery.\nDoctor: I see. Was there any fluid buildup in your abdomen?\nPatient: No, there wasn't any.\nDoctor: Okay. And were there any masses found in your ovaries?\nPatient: Yes, there were masses on both my right and left ovaries.\nDoctor: I see. And what was done about that?\nPatient: I was taken to the operating room in March and they took multiple biopsies. They also removed my left ovary and appendix.\nDoctor: I see. And what did the pathology report show?\nPatient: It showed a mature cystic teratoma and extensive malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.\nDoctor: I understand. And what happened next?\nPatient: Another CT scan was done in May and it showed that the malignant peritoneal mesothelioma was infiltrating my omentum and had accumulated as a mass in my pelvis.\nDoctor: I see. And what was the definitive treatment for her malignant peritoneal mesothelioma?\nPatient: I had a greater and lesser omentectomy, cholecystectomy, pelvic peritonectomy with hysterectomy and right oophorectomy along with cytoreductive surgery of the small and large bowel surfaces. And then I had HIPEC with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and systemic ifosfamide with Mesna.\nDoctor: I see. And what happened during the HIPEC procedure?\nPatient: They used scissor dissection to remove a layer of tumor from my large and small bowel surfaces along with my large and small bowel mesenteric surfaces. And to rule out disease within the mesenteric lymph nodes, they harvested six of these lymph nodes during the HIPEC chemotherapy.\nDoctor: I see. And what happened to the harvested lymph nodes?\nPatient: Portions of the nodes were sent for histopathologic analysis and other portions were sent for pharmacologic analysis of the intraperitoneal drug, doxorubicin.\nDoctor: I see. And what were the results of the doxorubicin within blood, peritoneal fluid, lymph nodes, and tumor?\nPatient: The area under the curve ratio of lymph node doxorubicin to plasma doxorubicin was 30.

The patient reported several-month right upper quadrant pain and 4-kg weight loss over the past year. There was no laboratory sign of obstructive jaundice at the day of admission. Preoperative CT and MR scan (Figs. and ) of the liver was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with a tumor in the gallbladder area with a relatively massive infiltration of the S5 and S6 liver segments and extensive regions of necrosis. Given the potentially resectable lesion according to preoperative imaging, exploratory laparotomy was indicated to attempt radical resection. During the exploration, a voluminous tumor was found attached to the peritoneum. Intraoperative ultrasound was performed and revealed a tumor originating from the gallbladder bed area and reaching up to the area of the hepatic hilum and extensive involvement of the hepatoduodenal ligament by the tumor through the lymph nodes. The tumor was classified as inoperable due to this finding. But during the exploration, however, a rupture of the fragile tumor occurred with massive eruption of the necrotic mass and the gallbladder content into the abdominal cavity, accompanied by bleeding of the liver parenchyma.

I see that you presented to our office in 2017 with complaints of chronic left knee pain. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I have been experiencing left knee pain for years and it's been getting worse with movements.\nDoctor: I see. Did you have any previous surgeries for this condition?\nPatient: Yes, I had multiple osteochondroma removal surgeries in my left knee, lumbar spine, and left foot at an outside institution. I also had a left hip arthroplasty with refractory numbness and tingling of the leg. \nDoctor: I see. Your electronic medical record from the outside institution indicated a past medical history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hereditary multiple exostosis. We will need to keep an eye on those conditions. \nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: We will need to take some Baseline X-rays of your knee to see if there are any osteoarthritic changes. \nPatient: Sure.\nDoctor: The X-rays showed osteoarthritic changes with significant osteochondroma formation. However, arthroplasty was not recommended at that time because of your young age and your left lower extremity being distally neurovascular intact. \nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: I understand that you were adamant about having your knee replaced and were referred to a specialist at an outside institution where an arthroplasty of the left knee was performed. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: The follow-up radiographs showed good alignment of a Smith & Nephew posterior stabilized prosthesis without subsidence. However, you returned 3 months later with continued limited active and passive range of motion. \nPatient: Yes, that's right. \nDoctor: It was decided to perform manipulation under anesthesia followed by 6 weeks of physical therapy which improved your range of motion to 110\u00b0 flexion. \nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: However, you continue to have limited range of motion of your left knee with flexion to 90\u00b0. The large posteriorly projecting osteochondroma of your left tibia continues to be asymptomatic and painless, and therefore, it was decided not to perform surgical interventions at this time. How are you feeling now? \nPatient: The arthroplasty helped with the pain, but I still have limited range of motion. \nDoctor: I understand. We will need to continue monitoring your knee and consider other treatment options if necessary. Do you have any other questions or concerns? \nPatient: No, I think that covers everything. \nDoctor: Alright, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to check on your progress.

She had normal urethral closure pressure and no bladder instability. The patient was selected for TVT placement under spinal anesthesia. Just after insertion of the TVT trocar, the bladder was examined by cystoscopy and there was no sign of perforation. We did not perform an additional cystoscopy after extraction of the trocar. The remainder of the procedure was uneventful. A 16-Fr urethral Foley catheter was used to drain the bladder, and the patient was hospitalized overnight. The next morning, approximately 24 h after surgery, the catheter was removed and she voided without residual urine. Approximately one hour after removing the catheter, she developed acute abdominal pain and a fever. An examination of the suprapubic area revealed diffuse abdominal rebound tenderness without any discharge from the operation site. Vital signs, urinary drainage and laboratory studies showed normal results. Computerized tomography of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated multiple dilated bowel loops and abnormal fluid collection in the peritoneal space (). A cystogram demonstrated a leakage of contrast media into the peritoneal cavity (). Cystoscopy also revealed a pinhead-sized ulcerative lesion on the right lateral wall, but with no visible perforation into the peritoneal cavity (). Emergency exploratory laparotomy via a lower midline incision revealed general peritonitis, as well as a large intraperitoneal hematoma, with the tape penetrating the pelvic peritoneum without concomitantly causing bowel injury. The right tape penetrated the deep layers of the bladder muscle and mucosa, close to the site of right trocar's passage. The hematoma around the perforated lesion was removed.

This originated from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm. Do you understand what that means?\nPatient: Not really, could you explain it to me?\nDoctor: Essentially, there is a tear in the lining of the aorta that has caused a bulge to form. This bulge could potentially rupture and cause serious internal bleeding, which is why we need to perform a surgical repair as soon as possible.\nPatient: I understand.\nDoctor: Before the surgery, we will need to adjust your blood pressure with an ACE inhibitor to minimize the risk of complications.

This hemorrhage showed mixed signals that indicated different ages of the pathology, but there was no hemosiderin rim on the T1- and T2-weighted MR (). The clinical differential diagnosis was primarily split between intratumoral hemorrhages originating from a pineal germ cell tumor, specifically choriocarcinoma vs. hemorrhage from a pineal cyst. The presence of a cavernous malformation was considered to be a less likely diagnostic possibility. We were easily able to rule out the possibility of vascular malformations because MR angiography revealed no such abnormalities (). Two weeks later, he experienced an improvement in the diplopia, but the headache that he had been experiencing became progressively more severe. Brain CTs, performed weekly after the first attack of symptoms, revealed a resolving hemorrhage and the progressively enlarging ventricles (). We performed VP shunting using the HAKIM programmable valve without the prechamber Shunt System, and it was adjusted to an opening pressure of 120 mm CSF. Two days after the shunting, he complained of a sudden aggravation of his diplopia. The follow-up brain CT revealed rebleeding from the previous lesion (). The patient underwent an emergency operation consisting of an occipital-transtentorial approach to the pineal region, and this resulted in the complete excision of a discovered tumor and the removal of the hematoma. The lesion mass was composed of acute and subacute hematomas and it was well encapsulated. These surgical findings corresponded to a cavernous malformation. The mass was easily separated from the surrounding tissues that included the midbrain. Although the mass had some fibrous connection with the internal cerebral vein, it was successfully"}

And where did you go for your first aim treatment?\nPatient: I went to a primary healthcare center at a peripheral hospital.\nDoctor: Alright. Based on your clinical manifestations, we treated you for pulmonary embolic disease with anticoagulant therapy. Later, we had to perform an emergency caesarean delivery to ensure the safety of your baby. How is your baby doing now?\nPatient: My baby's Apgar index was 3, 6, and 9 at minutes 1, 3, and 5 respectively. The weight was lower than expected.\nDoctor: Yes, the baby's weight was restricted due to the unknown pAVM. Ultrasounds during pregnancy showed a reduction in potential fetal growth from week 33 without any Doppler alteration.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: Also, during the caesarean section, we used general anesthesia because of your condition of increasing dyspnoea. Spinal anesthesia was not indicated due to the risk of association with other AVMs, especially in case of HHT.\nPatient: Oh, I didn't know that.\nDoctor: Yes, it's important to consider all the risks involved. After the caesarean section, we observed less than 10% infarcts on the placenta. However, your postoperative course showed a worsening of your clinical condition, leading to acute distress syndrome. We had to transfer you to the Gynaecology and Obstetrics unit for critical care.\nPatient: That sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it was a critical situation, but we did everything we could to ensure your safety and your baby's safety. Do you have any questions for me?\nPatient: No, I think you've explained everything very clearly, thank you.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Her past medical history did not present other hospitalizations for the same symptoms. Due to the clinical manifestations, the patient was initially treated as a case of pulmonary embolic disease and subjected to a massive anticoagulant therapy. Considering the clinical diagnosis and the child to term, an emergent caesarean delivery was performed in order to avoid foetal complications. The caesarean section was successfully performed under general anaesthesia using Stark's method due to the urgency related to the patient's clinical condition of increasing dyspnoea. Moreover, although the pAVM was still unknown at time of the caesarean section, the execution of spinal anaesthesia seems to be not indicated because of the risk of pAVM association with other AVMs, such as those located in the spinal cord, especially in case of HHT.\nThe foetal outcome showed an Apgar index of 3, 6, and 9, respectively, at minutes 1, 3, and 5; these data are in line with the administration of general anaesthesia and the acute maternal condition of severe dyspnoea.\nTaking into account the foetal weight at birth, it showed a restriction of the expected value. The child weight was in fact 2590 gr at 39 weeks of gestation. However, ultrasounds performed during the pregnancy reported a reduction of the potential foetal growth from the 33 weeks of gestation without any Doppler alteration.

The treating physician advised follow-ups on discharge. However, the parents decided to seek more medical help for the child and she was admitted for more investigations.\nOn physical exam, the child was alert and active. She was not jaundiced and no pallor was noted on the extremities. Her vitals were all within the normal range and the birth weight and changes in weight corresponded properly. Two masses measuring 26 mm by 19 mm and 19 mm by 17 mm were observed on the forehead and the scalp (Figures -). One smaller mass was seen on the abdomen, measuring 11 mm by 10 mm (Figure ). All three masses were red and non-hemorrhagic. The parents reported that the size of the masses did not change since birth. No similar family history was found and both parents were healthy. Any hepatosplenomegaly was not observed on palpation nor were any other cutaneous lesions detected. She did not present with any other systemic abnormalities.

The vomitus consisted of undigested meals eaten recently without any blood. During the last four months the patient reported a significant weight loss (21 kg). Her past medical history was free. On admission the patient was very thin and extremely weak with signs of severe dehydration. A nasophagogastric tube was inserted and the fluid and electrolyte balance was corrected by parenteric infusion of crystalloid fluids with electrolytes. Two days later the patient was subjected to gastroscopy which showed mild inflammation of the lower esophageal mucosa and gastritis. The instrument could not pass further than the third part of the duodenum, due to extraluminal pressure on the duodenal wall. Barium meal follow through confirmed the extrinsic obstruction of the third part of the duodenum and proximal dilation of the stomach and duodenum [] with normal motility of the upper GI tract. CT scan of the upper and lower abdomen excluded the possibility of a tumor or an annular pancreas being the cause of the compression of the duodenum. Thus based on the history, the clinical and imaging findings of the patient, the diagnosis of Wilke\u2019s syndrome was concluded.\nThe patient denied the initially suggested conservative treatment and therefore she was subjected to laparotomy. The first and second parts of the duodenum were dilated and hypertrophied. The dilated duodenum was abrupted at the point where the superior mesenteric artery crossed the third part of the duodenum []. These findings confirmed the diagnosis and a site to site duodenojejunostomy in two layers was performed []. The postoperative course was uneventful and barium meal a month postoperatively showed unobstructed passage of the contents from the duodenum to the jejunum. One year later the patient gained the lost weight and remained asymptomatic."}

The patient reported several-month right upper quadrant pain and 4-kg weight loss over the past year. There was no laboratory sign of obstructive jaundice at the day of admission. Preoperative CT and MR scan (Figs. and ) of the liver was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with a tumor in the gallbladder area with a relatively massive infiltration of the S5 and S6 liver segments and extensive regions of necrosis. Given the potentially resectable lesion according to preoperative imaging, exploratory laparotomy was indicated to attempt radical resection. During the exploration, a voluminous tumor was found attached to the peritoneum. Intraoperative ultrasound was performed and revealed a tumor originating from the gallbladder bed area and reaching up to the area of the hepatic hilum and extensive involvement of the hepatoduodenal ligament by the tumor through the lymph nodes. The tumor was classified as inoperable due to this finding. But during the exploration, however, a rupture of the fragile tumor occurred with massive eruption of the necrotic mass and the gallbladder content into the abdominal cavity, accompanied by bleeding of the liver parenchyma. We decided that the condition could only be managed by attempting modified resection. We performed cholecystectomy and non-anatomical resection of hepatic segments S5 and S6 and partial resection of S4 without lymphadenectomy as a debulking operation (Fig. ). The course of hospitalization was uncomplicated, and the patient was discharged to home care on postoperative day 9. Histologically, the tumor was confirmed as MINEN of gallbladder (Figs. , , and ), and its non-neuroendocrine component had the character of moderately differentiated tubular gall bladder adenocarcinoma, while the neuroendocrine component had the appearance of small cell carcinoma and was dominant, accounting for more than 65% of the viable tumor.

What do I need to do next?\nDoctor: Just keep taking your medication as prescribed and come back to see me in two weeks. And if you have any sudden changes in your vision or other symptoms, please come back to see me immediately.\nPatient: Okay, doctor. Thank you.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Take care.", "ideal_response": "A 78-year-old white caucasian lady presented to her local hospital with rapid loss of vision in her right eye over 12 hours. She had been suffering from non-specific joint pains for several months for which she had been receiving acupuncture. Ten days prior to her admission a rheumatologist had diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica based on her symptomatology and scalp tenderness, but she had not been started on steroid treatment. She had had an anterior resection for adenocarcinoma of the bowel in 2001 and a computed tomography scan six months previously showed no evidence of tumour recurrence. There was a past medical history of melanoma (resected from her right foot) in 1983, and a transient ischaemic attack but had no history of diabetes, ocular trauma or sinusitis. There had been no recent hospital admissions or medical procedures.\nInitial examination revealed a reduction in her visual acuity on the right to hand movements only, there was also tenderness over the right temporal artery. The left eye vision was normal. The right fundus seen with a direct ophthalmoscope showed an elevated, yellow, sub retinal macular lesion with associated retinal haemorrhages and cotton wool spots. There was no evidence of uveitis. The physical examination was otherwise normal. At this time her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 58 mm/hr, her C reactive protein 1 mg/L, total white cell count of 11.9 \u00d7 109/L. Giant cell arteritis was suspected to be the cause of her pain and she was commenced on 80 mg of prednisolone daily. After five days the pain worsened and became more localised to the right eye and she developed panuveitis with 1 mm hypopyon in the anterior chamber. She was transferred to our institute for further management. An ultrasound B scan of the eye showed retinal elevation at the macula, choroidal thickening and subretinal fluid suggesting the diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis. A vitreous biopsy was performed which showed the macular lesion to orginate from a subretinal mass accompanied by an area of macular retinitis with intense inflammatory"}
