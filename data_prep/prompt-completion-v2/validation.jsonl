I heard that you were referred to our department with a swollen cheek and eyelid. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, doc. I have a painless swelling on my right cheek and eyelid. It's been growing gradually for at least a month now.\nDoctor: Hmm, I see. Have you received any treatment for it?\nPatient: Yes, I was given antibiotics but there was no improvement.\nDoctor: Okay, I understand. Do you have any other symptoms like rhinorrhea?\nPatient: Yes, I do have clear rhinorrhea.\nDoctor: Alright. Do you have a history of close contact with sheep and dogs?\nPatient: Yes, I do.\nDoctor: Okay. Let's do a physical examination then. Can you tell me if there's any tenderness in the affected area?\nPatient: No, there's no tenderness.\nDoctor: Alright. I see a well-shaped, firm, and fluctuant swelling with subcutaneous penetration. Is there any evidence of inflammation?\nPatient: No, there's no inflammation.\nDoctor: Alright. Anterior rhinoscopy revealed lateral bulging of the right nasal wall. Your general condition is otherwise normal. \nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: Great. We also did a Computed tomography imaging of the face. It showed a loculated soft tissue density in the right maxillary sinus with erosion of the lateral and medial walls, as well as the floor of the orbit. The soft tissue density involved the orbit and compressed the globe. The appearance of the suspected mass by CT was suggestive of a cystic mass.\nPatient: Hmm.\nDoctor: We tried to perform a fine-needle aspiration but it failed to provide sufficient material for fluid analysis. Given the compression of the orbit, we decided to resect the mass.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: We adopted a Caldwell-Luc approach for the excision of the cystic mass. The mass in the maxillary sinus was yellow-white in color and elastic in nature, suggesting parasitic disease. We carefully removed the cystic mass and irrigated the sinus with hypertonic saline a total of three times. The macroscopic appearance of the extracted mass suggested a hydatid cyst. The cyst was enucleated easily, and multiple daughter cysts were found inside the capsule.\nPatient: Hmm.\nDoctor: The histopathologic examination revealed a hydatid cyst consistent with E. granulosus. A serologic test of the hydatid cyst revealed a positive 1/264 result, which further confirmed the presence of hydatid disease.\nPatient: So, what does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that you have hydatid disease. We also did an abdominal ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen and thorax, and it ruled out any visceral or pulmonary involvement in the hydatid disease. This confirmed the diagnosis of a primary hydatid cyst of the right maxillary sinus.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: You're in a healthy condition now after the surgery.

When did it start?\nPatient: It started back in November of 2015. I was diagnosed with a large uterine fibroid and had a myomectomy.\nDoctor: I see. Were there any malignancies associated with the specimens recovered?\nPatient: No, there were no malignancies found.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any other changes or symptoms since then?\nPatient: Yes, in December of 2016 I started feeling abdominal pain again and noticed a mass on the right side during a physical examination.\nDoctor: Did you have any tests done at that time?\nPatient: Yes, I had a colonoscopy and biopsy, which showed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the caecum.\nDoctor: I see. And what happened after that?\nPatient: A CT scan was performed in December of 2016, which showed the primary colon malignancy along with bilateral ovarian metastases.\nDoctor: Did you have any further tests or treatments?\nPatient: Yes, I had a percutaneous biopsy of the right ovarian mass, which showed a colonic primary. From December of 2016 through December of 2017, I was on chemotherapy.\nDoctor: What kind of chemotherapy were you on?\nPatient: Initially, I was treated with FOLFOX, but after four cycles, I had neuropathy and the oxaliplatin was stopped. I was maintained on 5-fluorouracil and bevacizumab.\nDoctor: I see. And how did that go?\nPatient: In December of 2017, a CT scan showed marked regression of the primary tumor. It was no longer visible, but multiple lymph nodes within the mesentery of the distal small bowel were enlarged.\nDoctor: And then what happened?\nPatient: A pelvic mass showed that the right ovary had increased in size to 15 cm in greatest diameter, despite the fact that the primary caecal malignancy was no longer visible by CT. Over approximately one month, I became rapidly more symptomatic with abdominal distention from ascites and an expanding right ovarian mass.\nDoctor: I see. And what did you do then?\nPatient: On February 1, 2018, I underwent cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC in a specialized center for management of peritoneal metastases.\nDoctor: What kind of surgery did you have?\nPatient: I underwent a greater omentectomy, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, complete pelvic peritonectomy, right colon resection, and small bowel resection.\nDoctor: And what kind of treatment did you receive?\nPatient: I received HIPEC with mitomycin C and doxorubicin, along with systemic fluorouracil.\nDoctor: I see. And were there any complications?\nPatient: In order to determine if the multiple enlarged lymph nodes within the small bowel mesentery were involved by cancer, individual lymph nodes were removed and subjected to histopathologic study by permanent sections at a later time.\nDoctor: I see.

The patient reported that the gingival enlargement started with the eruption of permanent dentition but progressed slowly to cover the entire permanent dentition. No single tooth was visible due to enlargement in anterior region whereas only occlusal portions of teeth were visible in posterior region. It was difficult to predict whether the positions of teeth were hampered due to massive gingival mass. However, the panoramic radiograph revealed normal bone height and tooth positioning.\nThe extra oral examination revealed an exaggerated convex profile with highly incompetent lips as the tissue bulge was protruding out of the mouth. The intra oral examination revealed generalised gingival overgrowth including both maxillary and mandibular arches extending into the vestibular areas []. The pink, leathery consistency tissue was hard on palpation and covered complete crowns of the entire dentition. The intra-oral examination confirmed that the patient used to masticate with assistance from the gums, however, no ulcerations were found on the occlusal surfaces of the enlarged tissue. A scanty amount of plaque and food debris was entrapped into the posterior teeth which were partially visible amongst the entire dentition with no significant inflammation present around them.\nRoutine blood investigations were done and values were found within normal range although haemoglobin values was slightly below normal range (8.5 gms%). The blood group examination was also done owing to the need for blood transfusion which was deemed necessary for maxillary arch gingivectomy after complete clinical evaluation.

I have a tumor in my right iliac bone that has been recurrent for a few years now.\nDoctor: Hmm, I see. Can you tell me more about the lump and the pain you are feeling?\nPatient: Sure, I first noticed a growing lump and pain in my right iliac bone about ten years ago. It intensified when I walked. I was admitted to a local hospital, and the surgeons removed the tumor. The studies showed that it was a low-grade chondrosarcoma.\nDoctor: I see. And what happened after that?\nPatient: Three years ago, I felt pain while walking and noticed a similar lump in the same area. Fifteen months ago, I visited my local hospital again because the pain and the lump were increasing. The studies following a needle aspiration showed the same diagnosis of low-grade chondrosarcoma. That's why I came to your department for more specialized surgical treatment.\nDoctor: Okay, I understand. Can you describe the physical examination after admission?\nPatient: Sure. The examination showed a 4- \u00d7 4- \u00d7 3-cm lump with a clear boundary and no mobility. I reported mild tenderness when placing pressure on the lump.\nDoctor: I see. And did you have any active infections or skin impairments that could prevent us from scheduling a surgery?\nPatient: No, I didn't have any active infections or skin impairments.\nDoctor: Okay, that's good. Did you have any sensory deficiencies or muscle atrophies?\nPatient: No, I didn't have any sensory deficiencies or muscle atrophies.\nDoctor: Great. The examination also showed no abnormalities in the muscle strength, sensory function, or circulation of your lower extremities, right?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: Alright.

Ten years previously, she had felt a growing lump and pain in her right iliac bone that intensified with walking. She was admitted to a local hospital, where the surgeons removed an osseous tumor from her iliac bone, and the subsequent pathological studies showed that it was a low-grade chondrosarcoma. Three years before presentation, the patient felt pain while walking and noticed a similar lump in the previously operated area. Fifteen months before presentation, she visited her local hospital because of increasing pain and growth of the lump in her right iliac bone. Pathological studies following fine needle aspiration showed the same diagnosis of low-grade chondrosarcoma. Three months later, the patient visited our department for more specialized surgical treatment. Physical examination after admission showed a 4- \u00d7 4- \u00d7 3-cm lump with a clear boundary and no mobility. The patient reported mild tenderness when placing pressure on the lump. The patient had no active infection or skin impairment that could prevent us from scheduling a surgery, no sensory deficiency, and no muscle atrophy.

He had undergone multiple investigations and was thought to have underlying Crohn's disease. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of his abdomen in January 2000 demonstrated a large abdominal mass. A laparoscopy was performed for tissue diagnosis of a possible lymphoma. However, at the time of laparoscopy, a large gelatinous mass was found and the diagnosis of PMP was confirmed by histopathology. Debulking surgery with small bowel resections was performed following this diagnosis at the Royal University Hospital of Saskatchewan.

The course of hospitalization was uncomplicated, and you were discharged to home care on postoperative day 9. \nPatient: Thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor.\nDoctor: Histologically, the tumor was confirmed as MINEN of gallbladder, and its non-neuroendocrine component had the character of moderately differentiated tubular gall bladder adenocarcinoma, while the neuroendocrine component had the appearance of small cell carcinoma and was dominant, accounting for more than 65% of the viable tumor. The neuroendocrine component contained extensive necrosis, with mitotic index 64/10 HPF and a proliferation index of 70%. \nPatient: Okay, what does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the tumor was a mix of different types of cancer cells with a high level of activity.

The patient reported several-month right upper quadrant pain and 4-kg weight loss over the past year. There was no laboratory sign of obstructive jaundice at the day of admission. Preoperative CT and MR scan (Figs. and ) of the liver was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with a tumor in the gallbladder area with a relatively massive infiltration of the S5 and S6 liver segments and extensive regions of necrosis. Given the potentially resectable lesion according to preoperative imaging, exploratory laparotomy was indicated to attempt radical resection. During the exploration, a voluminous tumor was found attached to the peritoneum. Intraoperative ultrasound was performed and revealed a tumor originating from the gallbladder bed area and reaching up to the area of the hepatic hilum and extensive involvement of the hepatoduodenal ligament by the tumor through the lymph nodes. The tumor was classified as inoperable due to this finding.

Due to your active asthma and the history of adverse events that occurred after contrast MR imaging, contrast imaging studies were not performed. Can you tell me more about your asthma?\nPatient: Yes, I have active asthma, and I had some adverse events after contrast MR imaging before.\nDoctor: Okay.

It was initially carried out by the medical team but, after teaching the mother, she performed the cervical stimulation with clinical control being carried out by the medical team initially every week, then every fortnight, and eventually once per month. Cervical stimulation is the only lymph drainage technique that has been evaluated in isolation and proven to be efficacious in the reduction of edema. The hypothesis of the mechanism of action is that cervical stimulation causes the contraction of the lymphangions thereby increasing drainage []. Cervical stimulation as monotherapy reduced the perimetry of the limb to within the clinically normal size range without signs of edema in the early morning when the child got up within around three months. At the age of six, a diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency was reached and hormone therapy was initiated. The child began to grow quickly with aggravation of the lymphedema with an increase of 3 cm in the perimetry of the dorsum of the foot. A hand-made low-stretch compression stocking of a cotton-polyester fabric (grosgrain) was added to the treatment regimen. This fabric has low stretch across the material and elasticity in the other direction thus allowing good flexibility of the limb but providing compression.

The ulcer was covered by a yellow pseudomembrane and surrounded by an erythematous halo (). There was no other abnormality elsewhere in the oral cavity. Based upon the clinical examination, a differential diagnosis included aphthous ulcer, traumatic ulcer, infections (bacterial, fungal and viral), drug reaction and malignancy, including primary squamous cell carcinoma and lymphoma. Since there was no history of any kind of trauma and the ulcers were chronic, painless and non recurrent, the possibility of traumatic or aphthous ulcers were ruled out. Moreover, the patient was not on any systemic medication; thus the possibility of ulcer due to drug reaction was also ruled out.\nAn incisional biopsy of the ulcer under local anesthesia was performed. Histopathologic examination of the excised specimen showed an ulcerated stratified squamous surface epithelium in association with fibro vascular connective tissue. The connective tissue exhibited granulomatous inflammation containing epithelioid cells, Langhans giant cells and lymphocytic infiltrate with areas of necrosis (Figures and ). This raised the possibility of granulomatous infection, including tuberculosis, sarcoidosis or fungal infection. Subsequent stains for fungi (PAS and Grocott's Silver) and"}

His prothrombin time international normalized ratio was 1.6, the hemoglobin was 9.7 g/dL and the platelet count was 223\u00d7103/\u00b5L. Physical examination revealed paresis of the left quadriceps muscle with strength of 4/5 and a diminished knee jerk reflex. The femoral, popliteal and dorsalis pedis pulses were palpable but slightly weak and no change in the skin color was found. He kept the left knee flexed and complained of aggravated pain when he extended the knee. Initially, vascular insufficiency due to partial arterial occlusion by thrombus was suspected. But computed tomography (CT) angiography and Doppler ultrasonography revealed patent proximal arteries and intact flows on the lower extremities. The source images for CT angiography revealed the iliacus muscle hematoma (). Because the left psoas muscle was compressed and displaced by the hematoma compared with right psoas muscle and the femoral nerve runs between the psoas tendon and the iliacus muscle, compression or displacement of the left femoral nerve was suspected. The warfarin was immediately discontinued and he was managed with pain control and regular neurological assessment. But, his pain and weakness were further increased over the next five days. He became unable to raise the left leg and to stand without assistance. Electromyography and nerve conduction study showed left femoral neuropathy. After confirming the normalization of his coagulation parameters, percutaneous catheter insertion was performed under ultrasonographic guidance for aspiration and drainage of the hematoma. However, only a small amount of the hematoma was drained and then surgical evacuation of the hematoma"}

Have you experienced any symptoms related to that?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any symptoms related to ovarian cancer.\nDoctor: Okay, let's move on to your personal history. I see that you were clinically and radiologically diagnosed with a mass on your right breast as a fibroadenoma 2 years ago. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: Yes, I had a mass on my right breast that was diagnosed as a fibroadenoma 2 years ago.\nDoctor: And did that mass grow in size?\nPatient: Yes, the same mass had a growth of 2 cm, so an incisional biopsy was performed at another institution.\nDoctor: I see. And what were the results of that biopsy?\nPatient: It was positive for mucinous carcinoma, and I was referred to your institution for treatment and follow up.\nDoctor: Okay, thank you for that information. After a revision of the biopsy slides, we found a tumor composed of mucinous lakes with numerous tumor cells of medium to large size with a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm, confirming the presence of pure mucinous carcinoma. We couldn't identify the tumor size and surgical margins by no prior radiological and pathological report. The tumor was classified as a low grade tumor (G1) based on the Scarff Bloom Richardson scale. We didn't observe perineural or vascular invasion. On immunohistochemistry the results were 100% and 90% positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors respectively with high intensity, and HER2 receptors negative.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: Moving on to your physical examination, we saw a surgical injury. Upon palpation, this zone felt indurated, edematous, and presented as a rough irregular texture. No other lesions were found. An ultrasound was performed, showing avascular distortion and a heterogeneous mass with microcysts. MRI showed a hypointense irregular mass that indicates a mild enhancement in contrast sequences and a hyperintense sequence in SPAIR. The evaluation of the lymph nodes was not suspicious for metastasis.\nPatient: Okay, what does that mean?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we performed a partial mastectomy and a sentinel lymph node biopsy. Pathological findings showed a residual mass of 25 mm of pure mucinous carcinoma with negative surgical margins. Sentinel lymph node was negative for metastasis.\nPatient: That's good news, right?\nDoctor: Yes, it is. However, molecular screening with EndoPredict clinic showed a score of 2.7, classifying it as a low risk. That's why we decided to treat you with tamoxifen because of your positivity to receptors and low risk showed in molecular assay.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: Of course. It's important that you understand your condition and treatment. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\nPatient: No, I think I understand everything.\nDoctor: Alright then, please make sure to follow up with us regularly and take your medication as prescribed.

The limiting factor was a pain in the lateral compartment of the left knee, which had become apparent about the same time as the heel pain. However, recurring knee pain had been known for several years before the referral.\nShe was suffering from breast cancer, which was diagnosed in 2014 and had been treated with surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Metastatic bone disease was ascertained at the time of diagnosis and consisted of lesions in the spine, pelvic bones, and several ribs. No recent progression of the underlying disease had been observed.\nIn the clinical examination, the heel pain was localized on both sides along the medial part of the insertion of the plantar aponeurosis on the calcaneus, as well as along the most medial bundle of its central part. Pressure on these areas elicited pain of the same quality and location as experienced during walking.\nA recent bone scintigraphy showed no tracer uptake in the feet. Uptake in the medial condyle of the left femur and of the left tibia was consistent with osteoarthritis.\nPlain radiographs revealed a plantar heel spur on both sides, without indication of bone lesions. The plain radiograph of the left calcaneus is shown in Fig. .\nUltrasound showed a thickening of the plantar aponeurosis near the insertion on the calcaneus, with a thickness of 4.9"}

I had an umbilical catheter placed for intravenous fluid administration, but the catheter position was not documented.\nDoctor: Okay, and have you had any other medical issues since then?\nPatient: No, I have been otherwise healthy.\nDoctor: Alright, let's take a look at the results of your laboratory analysis. It appears you have a condition called pancytopenia. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms besides fatigue and apathy?\nPatient: No, not really.\nDoctor: Alright, let me explain what that means. Pancytopenia is a condition where you have a low count of red and white blood cells, as well as platelets. Your liver function tests came back within normal limits, which is good news.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: We also performed a screening abdominal ultrasound and found a splenomegaly, which is an enlarged spleen. To rule out any other disorders, we did a magnetic resonance angiography, a liver biopsy, and pressure measurements.\nPatient: What did those tests show?\nDoctor: The MRA revealed a focal irregularity in the extrahepatic portal vein main branch, but the liver biopsy was normal without any signs of fibrosis or cirrhosis. The pressure measurements showed a wedged hepatic venous pressure of 11 mmHg and an inferior vena cava pressure of 9 mmHg.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that there is some pressure buildup in the veins in your liver and abdomen. We also performed a gastroscopy and found major varices in your lower esophagus and signs of hypertensive gastropathy. We had to endoscopically ligate the varices as they could be causing the anemia.\nPatient: So, what's next?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we have decided to perform a direct transhepatic portography and percutaneous treatment. This will involve accessing the right portal vein under general anesthesia and using ultrasound guidance.\nPatient: What will that do?\nDoctor: It will allow us to see if there is a stenosis or dissection in the main portal vein. We will also be able to see the very large gastric and esophageal variceal collaterals.\nPatient: What happened during the treatment?\nDoctor: We performed a venography and found a moderate focal stenosis of the main portal vein. The pressure measurements showed a pressure gradient of 10 mmHg. We tried to use a balloon angioplasty with a 10-mm diameter balloon, but it did not result in sufficient re-expansion of the stenosed segment.\nPatient's Family: Doctor, what does this mean for my daughter?\nDoctor: Unfortunately, the treatment did not have the desired effect. We will need to monitor her condition and consider other options for treatment.

Laboratory analysis revealed a pancytopenia as summarized in Table . Liver function tests were within normal limits. Her medical history was non-specific except for a preterm birth at 7 months and observation at the neonatal intensive care. At that time a venous umbilical catheter was placed for intravenous fluid administration. However, catheter position was not documented by abdominal plain film. There was no history of hepatitis or other diseases in this otherwise healthy girl. Screening abdominal ultrasound was within normal limits, except for a splenomegaly with a maximal splenic diameter of 17 cm. In order to exclude portal venous and hepatic parenchymal disorders a magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) as well as a transjugular liver biopsy and pressure measurements were performed. MRA revealed a discrete, focal irregularity of the extrahepatic portal vein main branch. The liver biopsy was within normal limits without signs of fibrosis or cirrhosis. Pressure measurements showed a wedged hepatic venous pressure of 11 mmHg and inferior vena cava pressure of 9 mmHg. Further, a gastroscopy was performed, revealing major varices in the lower esophagus and signs of hypertensive gastropathy. The varices were endoscopically ligated, as it was suggested that the anemia could be associated with occult or intermittent bleeding from these varices. Finally, additional laboratory analysis could not identify any thrombophilic parameter disorder. Based on these findings, it was decided to perform direct transhepatic portography and percutaneous treatment.\nUnder general anesthesia, access to the right portal vein was made using ultrasound guidance. Venography clearly revealed a moderate focal stenosis of the main portal vein, potentially associated with a focal intimal dissection.

Therefore, the pathological diagnosis of the tumor was T3N1M0 Stage III according to the TNM classification of the International Union for Cancer classification [].

The pathological diagnosis of biopsy specimens was signet ring cell carcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) did not show either enlarged lymph nodes or distant metastasis.\nThe gastric tube cancer was considered a contraindication for endoscopic resection because of the histological type and the fact that it had invaded the deep submucosal layer.

The patient disclosed that he had multiple osteochondroma removal surgeries which included his left knee, lumbar spine, and left foot at an outside institution. In addition, he had a left hip arthroplasty with refractory numbness/tingling of the leg. The patient stated he had left knee pain for years until he had an osteochondroma removed in his left distal femur in 2016 which seemed to help for 6 months. He stated the pain returned at 7/10 and is worse with movements. He had limited range of motion with 70\u00b0 of flexion, negative pain with varus and valgus movement, and negative secondary tests. Baseline X-rays were ordered for this patient's knee ().\nThere were osteoarthritic changes with significant osteochondroma formation; however, arthroplasty was not recommended at that time because of the patient's young age and his left lower extremity being distally neurovascular intact. The patient was adamant about having his knee replaced and was referred to a specialist at an outside institution where an arthroplasty of the left knee was performed. The patient returned 3 months later with continued limited active and passive range of motion (<90\u00b0 flexion). Follow-up radiographs were ordered showing good alignment of a Smith & Nephew posterior stabilized prosthesis without subsidence (). It was decided to perform manipulation under anesthesia followed by 6 weeks of physical therapy which improved his range of motion to 110\u00b0 flexion.\nThe patient continues to have limited range of motion of his left knee with flexion to 90\u00b0. The large posteriorly projecting osteochondroma of his left tibia continues to be asymptomatic and painless, and therefore, it was decided not to perform surgical interventions at this time.

Can you describe the pain to me?\nPatient: It's a sharp pain in my left flank.\nDoctor: How often do you experience these attacks?\nPatient: It happens about once a week.\nDoctor: Have you had any episodes of urinary tract infection?\nPatient: No, I haven't.\nDoctor: Okay, I see. We did some tests and the results showed that you have hydronephrosis and dilatation of the upper ureter.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: Hydronephrosis is a condition where your kidney is swollen due to a build-up of urine. The dilatation of the upper ureter means that the tube that carries urine from your kidney to your bladder is wider than it should be.\nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: We also did an Intravenous Pyelography (IVP) test and it showed that the left upper ureter is dilated and there is a sudden tapering.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: The tapering means that the width of the ureter decreases suddenly. Based on these results, we diagnosed you with left upper ureteric obstruction.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that there is a blockage in the left upper ureter that is preventing the urine from flowing properly.\nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: We performed a laparoscopic exploration surgery to find the cause of the obstruction. During the surgery, we found that the upper ureter was surrounded by a sheet of vessels.\nPatient: What did you do about it?\nDoctor: We found that the gonadal vein was making a U-shaped loop and was attached to the ureter at the apex of the U. We also found that the part of the gonadal vein attached to the ureter was thrombosed, so we ligated the vessels proximally and distally and removed the parts of the vessels attached to the ureter. We also performed complete ureterolysis at the site of obstruction.\nPatient: What happened after that?\nDoctor: We did a Doppler study to uncover any major vascular anomalies and it was found to be normal. We removed the Double J (DJ) stent after 15 days.\nPatient: Was everything okay after that?\nDoctor: Unfortunately, the patient continued to have abdominal pain again and a repeat IVP at 2 months showed similar obstruction as in the past. So, we had to perform another surgery and excise the obstructing segment and perform ureteroureterostomy.\nPatient: What happened after that?\nDoctor: An ultrasound done after 3 months showed complete resolution.\nPatient: That's great news!\nDoctor: Yes, it is. But we will need to keep an eye on you and do regular check-ups to make sure everything stays okay.", "completion": "An 8-year-old girl presented with recurrent attacks of left flank pain of 6 months duration. She had no episodes of urinary tract infection. Ultrasound revealed left hydronephrosis with dilatation of the upper ureter. Intravenous pyelography (IVP) showed hydronephrosis with dilated left upper ureter with sudden tapering and normal lower ureter below the area of tapering []. She was diagnosed to have left upper ureteric obstruction and was taken up for laparoscopic exploration.\nDuring surgery, we found that the upper ureter near the site of obstruction was surrounded by a sheet of vessels []. The ureter was sandwiched between a dilated periureteric vein and the gonadal vein. The gonadal vein instead of crossing from the lateral to medial side of the ureter, made a U shaped loop laterally, attached to the ureter at the apex of U and was seen draining into an abnormally placed lumbar vein with tributaries coming from above and below the confluence. The part of gonadal vein attached to the ureter was thrombosed with turbulent flow seen near the junction of gonadal vein with the lumbar vein. A small artery was seen entering the vein above the site of clot and causing turbulent flow in the vein. All the vessels were ligated proximally and distally laparoscopically and the parts of vessels attached to ureter were removed. The dilated gonadal vein attached to the left ureter was found to contain clotted blood. Complete ureterolysis was done at the site of obstruction. As ureter seemed normal, ureteroureterostomy was not done A line diagram is produced here for understanding the anomaly [].\nPostoperatively, Doppler study was done to uncover major vascular anomalies and was found to be normal. Double J (DJ) stent was removed after 15 days. Subsequently the patient continued to have abdominal pain again and a repeat IVP at 2 months showed similar obstruction as in the past.

He had been deemed not a PCI candidate based on his SYNTAX score and anatomy as well as being of too high risk for CABG. A thorough history revealed classic demand ischemia on exertion, and a physical examination was significant for a large discrepancy in the radial pulses with the left radial artery pulsation being significantly lower than that in the right arm. Blood pressure readings confirmed a difference of nearly 60 mmHg in systolic blood pressure between the two extremities. On cardiac catheterization, left subclavian stenosis was observed just distal to the origin of the artery as well as significant multivessel coronary artery disease and a porcelain aorta (). Further work-up included carotid duplex testing which revealed reversal of flow in the left vertebral artery confirming left subclavian artery stenosis, and noncontrast computed tomography verified the presence of heavily calcified ascending aorta.\nAfter numerous discussions with the patient, his family, and the interventional cardiology team, it was decided that total coronary revascularization via surgery was the optimal treatment.

An upper lip split incision was made to facilitate complete removal of the tumour and maintain the integrity of the orbital floor and allow safe dissection and release of the infraorbital nerve. The tumour was enucleated intact using an osteotome and a periosteal elevator, while maintaining continuity of the infraorbital rim and orbital floor. The ipsilateral buccal fat pad was mobilised and advanced to repair the maxillary defect, following tumour removal.\nHistopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of complex odontoma. The patient made an uneventful recovery and had no sensory nerve deficit. The extraoral incision has healed well with minimal scarring; the patient is pleased with the appearance and healing of his extraoral incision (). Prosthetic impressions were taken to facilitate construction of a maxillary obturator. To date, the patient has been followed up for a period of 36 months. There has been no clinical or radiographic evidence of recurrence. He will be considered for autogenous bone grafting and placement of osseointegrated"}

I'm Dr. Smith. How are you feeling today?\nPatient: Good morning, doctor. I'm feeling okay.\nDoctor: I see that you had a right knee amputation following a motorcycle accident in 1959. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: Yes, I was 19 years old at the time and I had a painless phantom that dissipated soon after the amputation. But I do experience paroxysmal shock-like stump pain two to three times a year that would settle within 24 hours.\nDoctor: I see. And have you had any painful neuromata?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any painful neuromata.\nDoctor: Okay. We first assessed your phantom pain in a questionnaire study in 2005 and more recently via an interview and clinical examination in 2009. Can you tell me more about that experience?\nPatient: Yes, I provided written, informed consent for the publication of this case report, and both studies were approved by local and hospital ethics committees.\nDoctor: I see. And in 2002, you were diagnosed with moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which had infiltrated through the full thickness of the bowel wall and into one regional lymph node, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct. I promptly underwent right hemicolectomy.\nDoctor: And I see that 15 days later you were diagnosed with pulmonary emboli and secondary pneumonia. And a thrombotic occlusion had developed in the right superficial femoral vein approximately 5 cm distal to the long saphenous junction and extending proximally to the level of the distal common femoral artery.\nPatient: Yes, that's correct. I was advised against prosthesis use until the blood clot cleared, which took about four months after the initial surgery.\nDoctor: I see. And you completed a six-month course of chemotherapy with leucovorin 38 mg and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 800 mg, which were administered with domperidone 10 mg and dexamethasone 4 mg to 8 mg. There wasn't any prophylactic administration of vitamin E before chemotherapy, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct. Little note was made of the effect that these agents had on my stump and phantom pain, except that I was advised to bandage my swollen stump during the third cycle and I reported nerve pain in the stump by the sixth cycle. The possible cause of stump swelling was not recorded.\nDoctor: I see. And you noted the presence of a painful phantom foot, telescoped near the stump, and a definite. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: Yes, I have a painful phantom foot that feels like it's telescoped near my stump. It's a definite pain and it's been bothering me for a while now.\nDoctor: Okay. I'll need to examine you and run some tests to see what's causing the pain. And I'll also need to see if there's any swelling or other symptoms that may be related.\nPatient: Okay.\n[Examination Happens]\nDoctor: I've finished the examination and I'll need to run some tests to get a better understanding of what's going on.

Among other minor injuries, the patient had suffered a small wound posterior to the tragus of his left ear (). Primary closure of the wound was performed at a local infirmary; no radiological investigations had been performed at the time. Ninety-six hours later the patient presented at our hospital with obvious signs of left sided peripheral facial paralysis (). The aforementioned wound was slightly painful on palpation but appeared inconspicuous otherwise. When questioned about the circumstances of the accident, the patient explained that one wheel of the quad bike had become detached at full speed, catapulting him into low growing brushwood.

The Patient was in his normal state of health until about 2 weeks before presentation when he developed toothache in the lower left quadrant of the jaw. He was advised by his friend to apply acidic chemical used to recharge car batteries to rinse the mouth. On first application of the acidic chemical, he experienced burning sensation and pain making him to immediately rinse with water, which gave him some relief. Some minutes later he reapplied the acidic chemical and held it in the mouth for some minutes \u201cso as to derive maximum benefit\u201d as advised by his friend which he later rinsed off with water but without much relief from the burning sensation and pain. Twelve days later, his medical condition worsened as the pain persisted and increased. He also noticed a swelling around the jaw which progressively increased in size to involve the face and neck.

Can you lie down on the table for me?\nPatient: Sure.\n[Doctor performs physical examination]\nDoctor: Hmm, I can feel a mass in your right upper abdomen. And your skin color and sclera look normal. Have you had any interventions for this pain prior?\nPatient: No, I haven't.\nDoctor: Alright. We've also received some lab findings for you. Your liver transaminase was slightly increased. Your alanine aminotransferase was 120 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase was 109 U/L, and r-glutamyl transpeptidase was 180 U/L.

An aspherical expansion of the cystic dilatation was detected by both MRI and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Based on these results, we've diagnosed you with a choledochal cyst.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: A choledochal cyst is a cyst that forms in the bile duct. We're going to perform a laparoscopic choledochal cyst resection to remove it.\nPatient: Okay.\n[Patient signs informed consent and undergoes laparoscopic choledochal cyst resection]\nDoctor: The surgery went well.

The cystic dilatation was found in the middle part of the cystic duct, and the caudal portion was found behind the head of the pancreas and converged into the common bile duct at an acute angle and low insertion.\nPatient: What happened next?\nDoctor: The surgery was converted to a laparotomy because of the unclear structure and the possibility of anatomic variation of the bile duct. The cystic duct was eventually removed because the drainage to the bile duct was through a narrow neck.\nPatient: Is everything okay now?\nDoctor: Yes, everything is fine now.

At that time, the patient underwent a transabdominal/transperitoneal partial nephrectomy. Due to the patient's complicated past medical history and her present gross hematuria, the decision was made to transfer the patient to our service for a higher level of care.\nAfter admission to our hospital, a transurethral catheter was placed, which showed gross hematuria. Upon further evaluation, the decision was made to perform a cystoscopy and evacuation of blood clots. The urethrocystoscopy showed no gross pathology in the urethra and bladder.
