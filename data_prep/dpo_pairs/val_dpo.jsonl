On readmission to hospital, she required 50% more intravenous insulin than on the previous admission to achieve glycemic control. Transitioning to subcutaneous human NPH and regular insulin at more than 400 units of insulin per day failed to control her hyperglycemia and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with U-500 insulin was started in conjunction with orally administered mycophenolate", "rejected_response": "**Clinical Note**\n\n**Patient Name:** [Redacted for HIPAA purposes]\n\n**Date:** [Current Date]\n\n**Chief Complaint:** Recent hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) diagnosis.\n\n**History of Present Illness:** The patient presented to the emergency department 10 days prior to admission with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss. Laboratory results revealed a serum glucose level of 594 mg/dl, metabolic acidosis, and elevated serum beta-hydroxybutyrate. The patient's serum glucose level was effectively managed with a low-dose intravenous insulin DKA protocol. The patient was then transitioned to a basal-bolus subcutaneous insulin regimen using detemir and aspart insulins.\n\n**Past Medical History:** The patient has no history of glucose intolerance or gestational diabetes. However, the patient's family history is positive for type 2 diabetes in the father and autoimmune thyroid disease in the sister and niece.\n\n**Laboratory Results:**\n\n* Serum glucose level at time of admission: 594 mg/dl\n* HbA1c at onset of treatment: 11.8%\n* GAD-65 antibodies: 3184.1 U/ml (positive)\n* Antipancreatic islet cell antibodies: 1:256 (positive)\n* Anti-parietal antibody: positive\n* Insulin antibodies: 13 \u03bcU/ml (elevated)\n\n**Current Medication:** Detemir 18 units at bedtime and aspart 8 units with each meal.\n\n**Follow-up:** The patient was seen as an outpatient 4 days after discharge and experienced a rapid increase in glucose levels. Despite rapid increases in insulin dosing, the patient's blood sugar levels did not lower, leading to the development of ketoacidosis. On readmission, the patient required 50% more intravenous insulin than on the previous admission to achieve glycemic control. The patient was eventually transitioned to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with U-500 insulin and orally administered mycophenolate.\n\n**Assessment:** The patient has been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus and has required multiple insulin regimens to achieve glycemic control. The patient's elevated insulin antibodies and positive GAD-65 and antipancreatic islet cell antibodies suggest an autoimmune component to the patient's T1DM.\n\n**Plan:** The patient will continue on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with U-500 insulin and orally administered mycophenolate. The patient will require close monitoring of glucose levels and insulin dosing to ensure optimal glycemic control.\n\n**Follow-up Appointment:** [Scheduled follow-up appointment]\n\n**Signature:** [Redacted for HIPAA purposes]\n\n**Title:** [Redacted for HIPAA purposes]"}
{"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that generates clinical notes from doctor-patient conversations.\n\nConversation:\n\nDoctor: Good morning, what brings you to the emergency today?\n\nPatient: I have been having severe colicky pain in my right upper abdomen for the past 7 days.\n\nDoctor: Hmm, okay. And have you been experiencing any other symptoms?\n\nPatient: Yes, I have been having episodes of non-bilious vomiting.\n\nDoctor: I see. Have you had any fever or any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?\n\nPatient: No, there has been no fever and no changes in my bowel or bladder habits.\n\nDoctor: Alright. And what about your personal history, is there anything that you think might be relevant?\n\nPatient: No, my personal history is not contributing to my symptoms.\n\nDoctor: Okay. When you came in, we noticed that you had some mild icterus and a tender gallbladder lump was palpable.\n\nPatient: Hmm, yes.\n\nDoctor: Alright. Let me take a look at your blood investigations. At admission, your Hb was 11.9 gm/dl, TLC was 15500/mm\n[], total bilirubin was 4.5 gm/dl, ALT 162 IU, AST 160 IU, Alk PO4 628 IU.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nDoctor: And an abdominal sonography showed a distended gallbladder with diffusely thickened walls, an ill-defined echogenic mass in the fundus and 13 mm sized calculi in the neck, and the CBD was 8 mm with a smooth distal tapering.\n\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\n\nDoctor: However, after your admission, you developed multiple episodes of vomiting with a history of passing a worm in your vomitus, waxing and waning jaundice, and episodes of severe haematmesis and melana.\n\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\n\nDoctor: Alright. Your Haemoglobin level decreased to 6 gm/dl, and an upper GI endoscopy showed an ulcer with a clot in the first part of your duodenum but no active bleed was seen.\n\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\n\nDoctor: Since you continued to have repeated episodes of upper GI bleed, we planned an angiography. Our video showed extravasation from the right hepatic artery into a sac-like structure, which was suspected to be a ruptured pseudoaneurysm.\n\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\n\nDoctor: Unfortunately, the microcoil embolization of the feeder artery was not successful, and the coil dislodged into the right branch of the hepatic artery.\n\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\n\nDoctor: An emergency laparotomy revealed dense adhesions in Calots triangle, a dark discoloration of the right lobe of your liver, and a gallbladder distended with clots.\n\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\n\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms and test results, we will need to keep you in the hospital for further treatment. I will explain the next steps to you and your family.\n\n[Patient's Family Joins]\n\nDoctor: Good morning, I just finished discussing your son's test results and treatment plan with him. He has a ruptured pseudoaneurysm and will need further treatment.\n\nPatient's Family: Okay, what do we need to do next?\n\nDoctor: We will need to keep him in the hospital for further treatment and monitoring. I will keep you updated on his progress.\n\nPatient's Family: Thank you, doctor.\n\nDoctor: Of course.
