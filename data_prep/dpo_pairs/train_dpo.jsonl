T2 weighted MR imaging revealed a 24.2 mm x 16 mm x 13.3 mm roughly ovoid AVM located in the right sylvian fissure.

Towards the end of the procedure and during the attempt to remove the microcatheter, its tip was noted to be adhered to the Onyx cast at the perinidal location. Unsuccessful attempts were made to withdraw the microcatheter by reducing the slack in the system, and traction was then applied over a period of 25 minutes. Given the tortuosity of the vessels and tension noted on the MCA branch, the decision to transect the catheter at the groin site was made to prevent acute intracranial vascular injury.

His main query reason to consult was a disharmonic low size. He has healthy consanguineous parents and 4 healthy brothers and sisters. All of them were informed and consent was given for a familial enzymatic and genetic study for lisosomal storage diseases. The index case sent 24 hours urine, dried blood spot (DBS), and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood. His father sent DBS sample and EDTA blood, but his mother, 2 sisters, and 2 brothers live in Morocco and the only sample sent was DBS.\nUrine quantitative analysis is based on the spectrometric determination of the binding of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) with 1,9-dimethylen blue, in 24-hour urine samples. The absorbance readings are performed at 630 nm, and the reference values depend on age.\nThis method allows us to detect the excretion of GAGs increased in urine, but it is not possible to differentiate the type of GAGs excreted. The qualitative analysis of urine GAGs was obtained by thin-layer chromatography to determine the predominant presence of dermatan sulfate.\nIn the enzymatic analysis, the action of the beta-galactosidase enzyme present in the DBS sample is determined on the fluorometric substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, releasing 4-methylumbelliferyl, which, at alkaline pH, produces fluorescence, proportional to the enzymatic activity. We adapted the methods of Hein et al,[ and Ho and O\u2019Brien[ to evaluate the enzymatic activity of arylsulfatase B (ARSB, EC 3.1.6.1) and beta-galactosidase (GLB, EC 3.2.1.23), respectively.

{"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that generates clinical notes from doctor-patient conversations.\n\nConversation:\n\nDoctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Not so great, doctor. I have been having some pain in my eyes when I move them.\n\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? When did it start?\n\nPatient: It started about two weeks ago, with pain in my left eye when I move it. Then I started to have some visual loss in the same eye. And then a week later, I started to have similar symptoms in my right eye.\n\nDoctor: Hmm, I see. And when you were admitted, what was your vision like?\n\nPatient: My vision was counting fingers in the right eye and I couldn't see anything in the left eye.\n\nDoctor: I see. And did you have any other symptoms besides the eye pain and visual loss?\n\nPatient: Yes, I also had some sensory symptoms in my legs and saddle area with urinary retention.\n\nDoctor: Okay, that's good to know. And when you were examined, was there a sensory level to pinprick in your back?\n\nPatient: Yes, there was a sensory level to pinprick at T8.\n\nDoctor: I see. And what was the appearance of your optic disc like?\n\nPatient: The doctor said it was normal.\n\nDoctor: Okay. And did you have any imaging done?\n\nPatient: Yes, I had MR imaging done.\n\nDoctor: And what did the MR imaging show?\n\nPatient: It showed T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of both optic nerves intracranially just anterior to the chiasm. And my brain appeared normal. But the MR imaging of my spinal cord showed a T2 hyperintense lesion within the distal spinal cord extending across 3 to 4 vertebral segments.\n\nDoctor: I see. And did you have a cerebrospinal fluid examination?\n\nPatient: Yes, I did.\n\nDoctor: And what was the result of the examination?\n\nPatient: There was a white cell count of 59/mm3, 78% of which were lymphocytes and the remainder polymorphs. And there were matched oligoclonal bands present in my CSF and serum.\n\nDoctor: Okay. Based on these results, you were treated with high-dose methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\n\nDoctor: And how was your recovery?\n\nPatient: My recovery was excellent. I made a great visual recovery. And when I was seen three months later, my visual acuity was 6/6 in my right eye and 6/9 in my left eye. And I had N5 bilaterally with no mistakes made on the Ishihara plates with either eye.\n\nDoctor: That's great to hear. And did you have any other symptoms after the treatment?\n\nPatient: No, I remained entirely well until a year later when I developed pain on moving my left eye.\n\nDoctor: I see. And did you have any imaging done then?\n\nPatient: Yes, I had MR imaging of my orbits done.\n\nDoctor: And what did the MR imaging show?\n\nPatient: It showed enhancement of my left optic nerve/sheath complex. But there was no loss of vision and my optic disc appearance was unchanged.\n\nDoctor: Okay. And what was your treatment then?\n\nPatient: I was treated immediately following the scan with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone.\n\nDoctor: And how was your vision at the time the steroids were given?\n\nPatient: My visual acuities were recorded as 6/5, N5 bilaterally with full colour vision. And there was no subjective deterioration in vision.\n\nDoctor: That's great to hear.

Can you tell me more about it?\n\nPatient: Yes, I started having a dry cough three days ago and then I started coughing up blood a day before I came to the hospital. It happened twice and each time I coughed up about a teaspoon full of blood.\n\nDoctor: Hmm, okay. Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss?\n\nPatient: No, I'm not. I'm actually feeling pretty good, just a little bit tired.\n\nDoctor: I see. During your physical examination, were there any abnormalities found?\n\nPatient: No, the doctor said everything was completely normal. My lung fields were clear when they listened to my breathing.\n\nDoctor: Okay, that's great. I see that your laboratory investigations, including a full blood count, renal function, electrolytes, and inflammatory markers, were all within normal limits. Is there anything in your past medical history that I should know about?\n\nPatient: No, my past medical history is pretty unremarkable. And I've never smoked cigarettes.\n\nDoctor: Alright. And is there anything else that I should know about your home environment or occupational exposures?\n\nPatient: No, there's nothing else.\n\nDoctor: I see.

That's why you were admitted for further investigations and treated symptomatically.\n\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\n\nDoctor: And a CT scan was performed which demonstrated a loculated effusion in the upper part of the oblique fissure with a well-defined, rounded, soft tissue density lesion embedded within and measuring approximately 7 x 5 cm without calcifications.\n\nPatient: Yes, that's what the doctor said.\n\nDoctor: Alright. This case was later discussed at a multidisciplinary team meeting and we have a plan to proceed with exploration and excision of the lesion.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nDoctor: Surgery was initially performed by the means of a thoracoscopy through a 12 mm port. The interlobar fissure cyst containing the lesion was large in size (10 x 7 cm), so it proved to be difficult to remove while keeping the cyst intact by thoracoscopy. This was important in order to avoid a sac rupture with the remote possibility of it being a hydatid cyst. Eventually, a right posterolateral thoracotomy through the fifth intercostal space was performed and the cyst dissected with complete excision.\n\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\n\nDoctor: Surprisingly, during exploration, another mass was noted in the upper lobe ipsilaterally and was excised.
